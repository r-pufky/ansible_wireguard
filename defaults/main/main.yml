# Wireguard Service Configuration

# See reference documentation for specific wireguard network configurations.
# Management of routing table and firewall services should be applied before
# this role (unless changes can be applied in standard wireguard adapter
# configurations).

# Is this role applied to a container?
#
# Decision: manual user setting - There is currently no good way to
#     deterministically and consistently detect if a remote host is a
#     container outside of common cases.
#
# Hosts marked as containers will automatically disable any sysctl changes:
#   * wireguard_service_ipv4_forwarding_enable
#   * wireguard_service_ipv6_forwarding_enable
#
# Special Case:
#   * srv_container_enable=true forces wireguard_container_enable=true.
#
# Default: False.
wireguard_container_enable: false

# Enable IPv4 forwarding?
#
# Enables clients to talk to each other through wireguard connections if their
# configs allow them to do so.
#
# Default: False (disabled).
wireguard_service_ipv4_forwarding_enable: false

# Enable IPv6 forwarding?
#
# Enables clients to talk to each other through wireguard connections if their
# configs allow them to do so.
#
# Default: False (disabled).
wireguard_service_ipv6_forwarding_enable: false

# Force refresh adapters?
#
# This will down and remove all existing adapters before creating them. If you
# are connecting to the host over wireguard, this can potentially BREAK YOUR
# CONNECTION. Useful for renaming or removing adapters.
#
# Default: False.
wireguard_service_force_refresh_adapters: false
